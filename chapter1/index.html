    <p>My favourite coffee is this seasonal pumpkin spice coffee from my local grocery store.
    It has orange peel, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and vanilla beans. It has
    been an absolute lifesaver with the all the weird temperature dips we've been
    having lately. The only downside is that for some reason they also added in pumpkin spice
    flavouring, which in my opinions was not needed. </p>
